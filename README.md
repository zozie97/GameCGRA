Run and Coded in Processing

The game is based on the game frogger. My game will have two different levels one an asteroid belt that the object has to move through and one a road with cars coming by. The asteroid level will be a little easier than the road level. The game will have a starting menu which you can get to the two versions of the game from and also while you are playing the game you can get to the start screen by pressing the key ‘A’.
